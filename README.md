# Finger Lakes Wine Trail

## About

Finger Lakes Wine Trail is a working prototype for a site with a focus on the Finger Lakes Wine Region. It uses jQuery Ajax calls to gather data on several wineries from Google Maps services as well as Wine.com.

The site uses Knockout for the ViewModel data management. ViewModel.js under the JS directory contains all the custom code for the site. 

## Usage

You will need to download the site to your local system and open the Index.html file in the top directory with your web browser. Note that this site wonâ€™t run through the github web service because of security issues with wine.com.

Click on a map marker or highlight a winery from the list to discover new bottle of the best wine from this region of New York State.

## Next Steps

- Verify that wine products pulled down are sorted by rating and are the top-rated product from that winery.
- Map outline of the region borders through Google Maps.
